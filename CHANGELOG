v. 1.0 January 2015 (Initial beta release)

v. 1.01 March 2015 (General release)
- NEW: added ability to supply a configuration notecard that will be read on
initialization and override scripted variable values (written by Seth Nygard -
thanks Seth!)
- TWEAK: tweaked Seth's configuration addition to support both his nameset as
well as the actual variable names being supplied
- TWEAK: slight further optimizations of memory use
- TWEAK: system is now made completely inactive if worn
- TWEAK: only owner is now notified when initialization completes
- FIX: minor text tweaks and typo corrections

v 1.02 May 2015 (Update Release)
- BUGFIX/OVERSIGHT: add flag so if an addon rezzes an object core is prevented
from interpreting this as an edit handle being rezzed and entering edit mode
- BUGFIX: fixed a bug in edit mode list wrapping where advancing from the last
animation in a group using "NEXT" would pull the incorrect data for the next
(first) animation.
- TWEAK: set a minimal sit target on root to allow sitting on it from distances
greater than 10m
- TWEAK: When displaying animation number range in dialog menu, display the
actual range instead of possible range
- NEW: added support for the Object-Rezzing prop add-on "NC_PROP" by Neo Cortex
(code from Neo)
- NEW/TWEAK: Altered script logic to optionally allow NPCs to occupy a PMAC
object with no "real" avatars being present and added a user configuration
variable to enable or disable this feature. By default it will be set to FALSE.
If the NPC is to be rezzed by another object/script that script will also need
to handle seating it, later unseating it, and removing it from the scene.
Initially rezzing a PMAC NPC still requires an avatar user but if that user
stands when NPC flag is TRUE, the NPC will not be removed (I'll need to sit down
again and remove it). Be careful NOT to reset the core script when a PMAC NPC is
still in the scene since this will strand it.
- NEW/TWEAK: Added new user option to show the groups menu instead of the
current group's animation menu when you first initiate the dialog. Subsequently
if you close the dialog and re-show it, you should received whatever your most
recent dialog was unless someone else was in control in the interim.

**** UPDATING FROM PMAC 1.01 TO PMAC 1.02 *****

- if you use in-script user settings instead of the configuration notecard,
transfer your settings to the PMAC core 1.02 script.
- delete the Core 1.01 script from your object's inventory
- place a copy of the Core 1.02 script into the object's inventory - it should
compile and enable itself automatically
- replace the old READ ME 1 and READ ME 2 notecards with the updated versions.
The other three core read me notecards remain unchanged.
- no further changes are require...your system is ready for use
- OPTIONAL: if you want to use the new object-rezzer add-on by Neo Cortex, place
a copy of it in the object's inventory and follow the instructions he supplied
for setting up your animations to use it. The MLP parser by Seth Nygard does not
currently support conversion of MLP rezzed objects so you will need to do this
manually.
